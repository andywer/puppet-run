# ü§ñ puppet-run

Run anything JavaScript in Chrome with puppeteer and pipe it's output back to your terminal üî•

Transparently bundles your input files and runs them in a headless Chromium browser.  Great for running tests in an actual browser!

How does it relate to [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io)? It's everything that Karma is not: It's small, it's fast and trivial to set up.

üöÄ&nbsp;&nbsp;Runs any script in a headless Chrome<br />
üì¶&nbsp;&nbsp;Zero-config transparent bundling<br />
‚öôÔ∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;Uses existing Babel, TypeScript, ... config if present<br />
üí°&nbsp;&nbsp;Supports TypeScript, JSX, Vue out of the box<br />
üñ•&nbsp;&nbsp;Pipes console output and errors to host shell<br />


## Installation

```sh
npm install puppet-run
```

We can use npm's [npx tool](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/162869356040/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner) to run the locally installed puppet-run program:

```sh
npx puppet-run [<arguments>]

# equal to:
# node ./node_modules/.bin/puppet-run [<arguments>]
```


## Usage

```sh
npx puppet-run ./path/to/script.js [arguments and options here will be passed to the script]
```

The script can basically be any JavaScript or TypeScript file. It will be bundled transparently using the [parcel bundler](https://parceljs.org). It usually works out-of-the-box with zero configuration. If you need to configure the build process, read up on how to configure `parcel`.

To run Mocha tests:

```sh
npx puppet-run --plugin=mocha [...mocha options] ./path/to/*.test.js
```

Print some help on how to use the tool:

```sh
npx puppet-run --help
```

Print help text how to use this plugin:

```sh
npx puppet-run --plugin=mocha --help
```


## Example

Let's see how a simple script looks like:

```js
// cowsays.js
import * as cowsay from "cowsay"

// You can use window.*, since this will be run in Chrome
const text = window.atob("SSBydW4gaW4gYSBicm93c2Vy")

// Everything logged here will be piped to your host terminal
console.log(cowsay.say({ text }))

// Explicitly terminate the script when you are done
puppet.exit()
```

Recognize the final `puppet.exit()`? You have to explicitly tell puppet-run when the script is done doing its thing.

Have a look at the section "Scripting API" below to learn more about that globally available `puppet` object.

Let's have some fun and see our sample script run in all its glory!

```sh
npx puppet-run ./cowsays.js
```

```

## Plugins

Plugins make it easy to integrate your script with testing frameworks or other external functionality. Check out the [plugins repository](https://github.com/andywer/puppet-run-plugins).

Here is how to use the mocha plugin:

```sh
npm install puppet-run-plugin-mocha
npx puppet-run --plugin=mocha ./*.test.js [--reporter "spec"]
```

This way you can just pass an arbitrary usual mocha test file without having to care about `puppet.exit()` or any boilerplate code.

You can also get help how to use a plugin:

```sh
npx puppet-run --plugin=mocha --help
```


## Scripting API

The script runner will inject a `puppet` object into the browser window's global scope. It contains a couple of useful functions.

#### `puppet.argv: string[]`

Contains all the command line arguments and options passed to `puppet-run` after the script file path.

#### `puppet.exit(exitCode: number = 0)`

Causes the script to end. The `puppet-run` process will exit with the exit code you pass here.

The exit code defaults to zero.

#### `puppet.setOfflineMode(takeOffline: boolean = true)`

Puts the browser in offline mode and closes all active connections if called with `true` or no arguments. Call it with `false` to bring the browser back online.


## More features

### Environment variables

You can access all environment variables of the host shell in your scripts as `process.env.*`.

### Source Maps

If an error is thrown, you will see the error and stack trace in your host shell. The stack trace will reference your source file lines, not the line in the bundle file that is actually served to the browser under the hood.


## Samples

Have a look at the samples in the [`sample`](./sample) directory:

- [Simple Testing](./sample/basic)
- [Simple Mocha Test](./sample/mocha)
- [React / Enzyme Test](./sample/mocha-enzyme)
- [Tape Test](./sample/tape)


## Test framework support

If you want to run tests in the browser using puppet-run, check out this list first:

#### ‚úÖ Mocha

Works like a charm, see [`sample/mocha`](./sample/mocha) or [`sample/mocha-enzyme`](./sample/mocha-enzyme). They use the [Mocha Plugin](https://github.com/andywer/puppet-run-plugins/tree/master/packages/puppet-run-plugin-mocha).

#### ‚úÖ Tape

Works like a charm, see [`sample/tape`](./sample/tape).

#### ‚ùå AVA

Currently not possible, since it's testing library and test runner code are too tightly coupled.

#### ‚ùî Jest

Didn't try yet.
