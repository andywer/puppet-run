# ü§ñ puppet-run

Run anything JavaScript in a headless Chrome from your command line üî•

Transparently bundles your input files using the [Parcel bundler](https://parceljs.org). Why? Because [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) sucks.

üöÄ&nbsp;&nbsp;Runs any script in a headless browser<br />
üì¶&nbsp;&nbsp;Zero-config transparent bundling<br />
üí°&nbsp;&nbsp;Supports TypeScript, React, Vue out of the box<br />
üñ•&nbsp;&nbsp;Pipes console output and errors to host shell<br />

## Installation

```sh
npm install puppet-run
```

## Usage

```sh
npx puppet-run ./path/to/script.js [arguments and options here will be passed to the script]
```

The script can basically be any JavaScript or TypeScript file. It will be bundled transparently using the [parcel bundler](https://parceljs.org). It usually works out-of-the-box with zero configuration. If you need to configure the build process, read up on how to configure `parcel`.

Let's see how a simple script looks like:

```js
// cowsays.js
import * as cowsay from "cowsay"

const text = window.atob("SSBydW4gaW4gYSBicm93c2Vy")

// Everything logged here will be piped to your host terminal
console.log(cowsay.say({ text }))

puppet.exit()
```

Recognize the final `puppet.exit()`? You have to explicitly tell puppet-run when the script is done doing its thing.

Have a look at the section "Scripting API" below to learn more about that globally available `puppet` object.

Let's have some fun and see our sample script run in all its glory!

```sh
npx puppet-run ./cowsays.js
```

```

## Plugins

Plugins make it easy to integrate your script with testing frameworks or other external functionality. Check out the [plugins repository](https://github.com/andywer/puppet-run-plugins).

Here is how to use the mocha plugin:

```sh
npm install puppet-run-plugin-mocha
npx puppet-run plugin:mocha ./*.test.js [--reporter "spec"]
```

This way you can just pass an arbitrary usual mocha test file without having to care about `puppet.exit()` or any boilerplate code.

You can also get help how to use a plugin:

```sh
npx puppet-run plugin:mocha --help
```


## Scripting API

The script runner will inject a `puppet` object into the browser window's global scope. It contains a couple of useful functions.

#### `puppet.argv: string[]`

Contains all the command line arguments and options passed to `puppet-run` after the script file path.

#### `puppet.exit(exitCode: number = 0)`

Causes the script to end. The `puppet-run` process will exit with the exit code you pass here.

The exit code defaults to zero.


## Test framework support

If you want to run tests in the browser using puppet-run, check out this list first:

#### ‚úÖ Mocha

Works like a charm, see [`sample/mocha`](./sample/mocha) or [`sample/mocha-enzyme`](./sample/mocha-enzyme).

#### ‚úÖ Tape

Works like a charm, see [`sample/tape`](./sample/tape).

#### ‚ùå AVA

Currently not possible, since it's testing library and test runner code are too tightly coupled.

#### ‚ùî Jest

Didn't try yet.


## Samples

Have a look at the [`sample`](./sample) directory.
